# Energy-Efficiency-classification-on-building-parameters
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook and a dataset and is part of the final project in "Machine Learning", a course in MSc Data Analytics and Decision Science at RWTH Business School. 

The notebook uses various data manipulation and machine learning techniques to classify heating and cooling loads based on building parameters namely: relative compactness, surface area, wall area, roof area, overall height, orientation, glazing area, and glazing area. The goal is to leverage such approaches in designing energy-efficient buildings and HVAC systems to reduce energy waste and its adverse effect on the climate.  
The dataset belongs to Tsanas et. al., 2012.
